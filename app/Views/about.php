            A website will allow your business or organization to be open 24 x 7.  Having a website is the equivalent of having an employee working around the clock – even weekends and holidays!

            Think of your website as being your online brochure or catalogue. It is much easier and quicker to update information about your products and services on your website than in print material, making it an effective way of letting your customers know about the arrival of new products, upcoming events, special promotions, or any new services you now offer. Unlike print ads which quickly become outdated, your website can provide current information and news.
